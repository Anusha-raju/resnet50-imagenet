# resnet50-imagenet
This repository contains code to train the ResNet-50 deep convolutional neural network from scratch on the ImageNet dataset using Amazon EC2 instances. The goal of this project is to explore and implement a complete end-to-end pipeline for training ResNet-50, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, on a cloud infrastructure.
